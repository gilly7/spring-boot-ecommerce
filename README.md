# spring-boot-ecommerce
an E-Commerce Application from Scratch Using Java and Spring
## Requirements

For building and running the application you need:

- [JDK 1.8 or later](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html)
- [Maven 3 or later](https://maven.apache.org)

## Running the application locally

There are several ways to run a Spring Boot application on your local machine. One way is to execute the `main` from your IDE.

Alternatively you can use the [Spring Boot Maven plugin](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/build-tool-plugins-maven-plugin.html) like so:

```shell
mvn spring-boot:run
```

We follow this pattern to make the codebase maintainable, instead of having spaghetti code, which can be a nightmare in long term.
